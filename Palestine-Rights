ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ PALESTINIAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN MANIFESTO  
"Right to Return. Right to Live."

ðŸŸ© 1. INTRODUCTION  
We, supporters of justice and peace, call on global citizens, institutions, and governments to recognize and act upon the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people â€” based on international law, historical truth, and human dignity.

ðŸŸ¥ 2. OUR DEMANDS  
- End the Gaza blockade immediately â€” ensure safe access to food, water, medicine, and power.  
- Enforce UN Resolution 194 â€” affirming the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees or fair compensation.  
- Uphold UN Resolution 242 â€” calling for the end of occupation and establishment of secure, recognized borders.  
- Recognize and support Palestinian statehood â€” within 1967 borders, including East Jerusalem as its capital.  

ðŸŸ¦ 3. WHY IT MATTERS  
- Over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza live under siege, suffering starvation, disease, and total collapse of infrastructure.  
- Illegitimate settlements expand daily, erasing Palestinian homes and fragmenting communities.  
- Generations of displacement have left millions stateless, voiceless, and denied basic rights.  

ðŸŸ¨ 4. OUR VISION  
- A peaceful, two-state future where Israelis and Palestinians live side-by-side with mutual dignity and equal sovereignty.  
- A world that upholds human rights above force and law above occupation.  
- Justice that heals, not vengeance that divides.
